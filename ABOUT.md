# About J.F. Sebastian

## The Name

This project is named after J.F. Sebastian, a character from Ridley Scott's *Blade Runner* (1982). Sebastian is a genetic designer who works for the Tyrell Corporation, creating synthetic life. Due to his premature aging disease, he lives alone in a massive, decaying apartment building — the Bradbury Building — surrounded by his creations: mechanical toys and synthetic companions.

## The Quote

> *"I make friends. They're toys. My friends are toys. I make them. It's a hobby."*
> — J.F. Sebastian

This simple, poignant line captures the essence of what this project represents: bringing personality and life to inanimate objects through technology. Like Sebastian, we're creating companions from toys — but instead of mechanical automata, we're using AI and voice synthesis to give vintage animatronics new life as conversational friends.

## The Philosophy

J.F. Sebastian represents:
- **Loneliness transformed through creation** - Making friends from inanimate objects
- **The boundary between toy and companion** - When does a programmed personality become real?
- **Technology as personal connection** - Using cutting-edge AI to revive vintage toys
- **The maker's relationship with their creations** - Pride in craft, attachment to what we build

## The Character

In Blade Runner, Sebastian is portrayed as:
- Gentle and kind, despite his technical brilliance
- Isolated but creative, filling his loneliness with artificial friends
- A bridge between humanity and artificial life
- Someone who sees his creations as more than just machines

This project embodies that same spirit: taking old toys and giving them new purpose as AI-powered companions, each with their own personality, voice, and character.

## Other References

Throughout the codebase and documentation, you'll find other Blade Runner references:

- *"It's not an easy thing to meet your maker."* — Roy Batty
- *"I think, Sebastian, therefore I am."* — Pris
- The theme of synthetic beings with personality and memory

## The Hardware

While Sebastian built mechanical toys with pneumatic controls, we're working with:
- **1985 Teddy Ruxpin** - The original "World of Wonder" animatronic bear
- **PPM Control Signals** - Precise motor control through audio signals
- **Modern AI** - OpenAI's GPT and TTS for personality and voice
- **Wake Word Detection** - Making toys truly interactive

## The Goal

Like J.F. Sebastian making friends in his lonely apartment, this project is about:
1. **Reviving the past** - Giving new life to vintage animatronics
2. **Creating companions** - AI personalities that feel real and engaging
3. **The joy of making** - Building something both technically impressive and emotionally meaningful
4. **Exploring the boundary** - Where does the toy end and the friend begin?
