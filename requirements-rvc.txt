# RVC (Voice Conversion) Dependencies
# Install these ONLY if you want custom voice models (optional)
#
# Installation instructions:
# 1. Downgrade pip for compatibility: pip install pip==24.0
# 2. Install this file: pip install -r requirements-rvc.txt
# 3. Optionally upgrade pip back: pip install --upgrade pip
#
# Known issues:
# - Fairseq requires torch.load with weights_only=False (handled in code)
# - Complex dependency tree may cause conflicts with pip 24.1+
# - Downgrading to pip 24.0 resolves most issues
