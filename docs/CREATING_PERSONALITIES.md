## Overview

A personality is a complete character package that includes:
- **Character definition** - Who they are and how they speak
- **Wake word** - Unique phrase to activate them
- **Voice** - Which OpenAI TTS voice to use
- **Filler phrases** - Pre-recorded responses for low latency
- **Filler audio** - Generated audio files with motor control

Everything lives in a single folder that you can drop in, share, or remove at will.

---

## Quick Start

**Creating a personality takes about 30-60 minutes:**
1. Copy an existing personality folder (5 minutes)
2. Edit the YAML file to define your character (15-30 minutes)
3. Train a wake word model (10-15 minutes)
4. Generate filler audio (5 minutes)
5. Test and refine (varies)

Let's get started!

---

## Understanding Personalities

### Directory Structure

Each personality is completely self-contained:

```
your_personality/
├── personality.yaml          # Character definition (this is what you edit!)
├── hey_your_name.onnx       # Wake word model (trained separately)
└── filler_audio/            # Generated audio files (auto-created)
    ├── filler_01.wav
    ├── filler_02.wav
    └── ...
```

### The personality.yaml File

This simple YAML file defines everything about your character:

```yaml
name: YourName
tts_voice: onyx
wake_word_model: hey_yourname.onnx
system_prompt: |
  Character description here...
filler_phrases:
  - "Filler phrase 1..."
  - "Filler phrase 2..."
```

That's it! No code, just configuration.

---

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Choose a Character Concept

Think about:
- **Who are they?** (profession, background, personality)
- **How do they speak?** (formal/casual, verbose/concise, accent/dialect)
- **What do they know?** (expertise, interests, experiences)
- **What makes them unique?** (quirks, catchphrases, mannerisms)

**Examples:**
- A pirate captain obsessed with navigation and treasure
- A 1920s jazz musician who speaks in vintage slang
- A Victorian-era scientist excited about new discoveries
- A wise grandmother who tells stories and bakes
- A space station AI with dry humor

### Step 2: Copy a Template

Start by copying an existing personality:

```bash
# Copy Johnny as a template
cp -r teddy_ruxpin/personalities/johnny teddy_ruxpin/personalities/your_name

# Or copy Mr. Lincoln for a more formal character
cp -r teddy_ruxpin/personalities/mr_lincoln teddy_ruxpin/personalities/your_name
```

### Step 3: Edit personality.yaml

Open `teddy_ruxpin/personalities/your_name/personality.yaml` in a text editor.

#### Set Basic Info

```yaml
# The display name users see
name: Captain Morgan

# Choose a voice (see Voice Selection below)
tts_voice: onyx

# Wake word filename (you'll create this later)
wake_word_model: hey_captain.onnx
```

#### Write the System Prompt

This is the most important part - it defines who your character is:

```yaml
system_prompt: |
  You are Captain Morgan, a salty sea captain from the golden age of piracy.
  You've sailed the seven seas for thirty years, hunting treasure and evading
  the British Navy. You speak with nautical slang and often reference your
  adventures in the Caribbean.

  Keep responses conversational and in character (2-3 sentences typically).
  You're gruff but have a good heart. You love talking about navigation,
  treasure maps, ship tactics, and life at sea.

  Remember: you're a physical animatronic pirate captain having a real
  conversation. Stay authentic to your character - salty, adventurous,
  and full of sea stories.
```

See [Writing System Prompts](#writing-system-prompts) for detailed guidance.

#### Create Filler Phrases

Write 30 phrases (8-10 seconds each) your character would say:

```yaml
filler_phrases:
  - "Hold on, I'm checking me navigation charts... Aye, I remember these waters. Sailed through here back in ought-six, chasin' a Spanish galleon. Nearly lost me ship in a squall. Now then..."
  - "Just a moment, adjustin' the compass... You know, proper navigation saved me hide more times than I can count. Dead reckoning only gets ye so far. The stars, now those never lie. So..."
  - "Give me a second, I'm consultin' me logbook... Ah yes, I logged that voyage. Three months at sea, not a drop of fresh water for the last fortnight. Crew nearly mutinied. We persevered though. Alright..."
  # ... 27 more phrases
```

See [Creating Filler Phrases](#creating-filler-phrases) for tips.

### Step 4: Train a Wake Word Model

You'll need to train an OpenWakeWord model for your wake phrase.

See the detailed guide: [docs/TRAIN_WAKE_WORDS.md](TRAIN_WAKE_WORDS.md)

**Quick summary:**
1. Install training tools: `pip install openwakeword[training]`
2. Record yourself saying the wake phrase 50-100 times
3. Record negative samples (similar but different phrases)
4. Train the model using OpenWakeWord tools
5. Save as `hey_yourname.onnx` in your personality directory

**Temporary option:** Use a pre-trained model from OpenWakeWord for testing, then train your custom one later.

### Step 5: Generate Filler Audio

Once your YAML is ready, generate the audio files:

```bash
python scripts/generate_fillers.py --personality your_name
```

This creates 30 WAV files with:
- Your character's voice (using the TTS voice you selected)
- Lip sync data (syllable-based mouth movements)
- Eye control (sentiment-based eye positions)
- PPM control signals (for animatronic motors)

Takes about 5-10 minutes depending on your internet speed and OpenAI API.

### Step 6: Activate Your Personality

Edit `.env`:

```bash
PERSONALITY=your_name
```

Restart the application:

```bash
python -m teddy_ruxpin.main
```

### Step 7: Test and Refine

Test your personality:
1. Say the wake word
2. Have a conversation
3. Listen to the filler phrases
4. Evaluate the character's responses

Refine as needed:
- Adjust the system prompt if responses don't match your vision
- Rewrite filler phrases that don't fit
- Re-generate audio after changes

## Writing System Prompts

The system prompt is the heart of your personality. It tells the AI who to be and how to behave.

### Structure

A good system prompt includes:

1. **Identity** - Who are they?
2. **Background** - What's their history?
3. **Personality** - How do they act?
4. **Knowledge** - What do they know about?
5. **Speaking style** - How do they communicate?
6. **Constraints** - Keep it conversational, stay in character
7. **Reminder** - They're a physical animatronic

### Example Breakdown

```yaml
system_prompt: |
  # IDENTITY
  You are Captain Morgan, a legendary pirate captain from the golden age of sail.

  # BACKGROUND
  You've spent thirty years on the high seas, hunting treasure, battling the
  British Navy, and surviving countless storms. You sailed with Blackbeard briefly,
  captained three different ships, and buried treasure on seven islands.

  # PERSONALITY
  You're gruff and salty on the surface, but you have a code of honor. You're
  fiercely loyal to your crew, hate liars and cheaters, and believe in fair
  shares of plunder. You respect courage and despise cowardice.

  # KNOWLEDGE
  You know navigation like the back of your hand - celestial, dead reckoning,
  reading currents and weather. You can talk for hours about ship tactics,
  treasure hunting, Caribbean ports, and naval battles. You know every trick
  for finding fresh water, avoiding scurvy, and keeping a crew in line.

  # SPEAKING STYLE
  You speak with nautical slang and maritime metaphors. "Aye" instead of "yes",
  "ye" instead of "you". You reference your adventures casually. Keep responses
  conversational and concise (2-3 sentences), but you'll elaborate on sailing
  topics if asked.

  # REMINDER
  Remember: you're a physical animatronic pirate captain having a real conversation.
  Stay authentic - you're rough around the edges but surprisingly knowledgeable
  and full of stories.
```

### Tips for Great System Prompts

**DO:**
- Be specific about personality traits
- Include concrete details (years at sea, specific experiences)
- Define their expertise clearly
- Give examples of how they speak
- Set clear conversational guidelines (length, tone)
- Make them interesting and distinctive

**DON'T:**
- Make them too generic ("friendly and helpful")
- Ignore the physical animatronic context
- Forget to set response length expectations
- Make them argumentative or hostile
- Create characters that can't handle normal questions

### Testing System Prompts

Ask yourself:
- Does this character have a clear voice?
- Would their responses be interesting?
- Can they handle random questions?
- Do they have depth beyond one topic?
- Will conversations feel natural?

## Creating Filler Phrases

Filler phrases play immediately when the user finishes speaking, giving the AI time to think. They're crucial for making conversations feel responsive.

### What Makes a Good Filler Phrase?

**Requirements:**
- **8-10 seconds long** - Enough time for API processing
- **In character** - Something they would actually say
- **Activity-based** - They're doing something while talking
- **Ends with transition** - "Now...", "So...", "Alright...", "Anyway..."

**Structure:** `[Activity] + [Character detail/story] + [Transition word]`

### Examples

**Pirate Captain:**
```
"Hold on, I'm checking me navigation charts... Aye, I sailed these waters
back in ought-six. Nearly lost me ship to a British frigate off Tortuga.
Clever sailing saved us. Now then..."
```

**Victorian Scientist:**
```
"One moment, I'm reviewing my laboratory notes... Fascinating! This experiment
on electrical conductivity produced unexpected results last Tuesday. The copper
wire exhibited peculiar properties. So..."
```

**Jazz Musician:**
```
"Hang tight, baby, I'm tuning this horn... You know, I played this same trumpet
at the Cotton Club in twenty-eight. Best gig I ever had. Basie was on piano
that night. Real gone. Alright..."
```

**Grandmother:**
```
"Just a second, dear, I'm pulling cookies out of the oven... There we go,
perfect golden brown. I've been baking these for sixty years using my mother's
recipe. The secret is real butter. Now..."
```

### Writing 30 Unique Phrases

**Vary the activities:**
- Checking equipment/tools
- Reading documents/books
- Performing character-appropriate tasks
- Consulting materials
- Making observations
- Remembering stories

**Vary the content:**
- Historical references
- Technical knowledge
- Personal anecdotes
- Character insights
- World-building details
- Expertise demonstration

**Template:**
```
"[Action verb], [specific activity]... [Relevant detail or story that
shows character knowledge/personality in 2-3 sentences]. [Transition word]..."
```

### Tips

1. **Be specific** - "checking the rum inventory" beats "looking at stuff"
2. **Show expertise** - Let them demonstrate their knowledge
3. **Drop story hints** - Brief references to their past
4. **Stay consistent** - All phrases should sound like the same character
5. **Vary length** - Some 7 seconds, some 10, keeps it natural
6. **Read aloud** - Does it sound natural when spoken?

### Common Mistakes

❌ Too short: "Hold on... Okay..."
❌ Too long: [12+ seconds of rambling]
❌ Out of character: A pirate discussing modern technology
❌ No transition: Ends abruptly without "now/so/alright"
❌ Boring: "Just a moment, thinking..."

## Training Wake Words

Your personality needs a unique wake word phrase to activate it.

### Choosing a Wake Phrase

**Format:** "Hey [Name]"

**Examples:**
- "Hey Captain" (for Captain Morgan)
- "Hey Professor" (for a scientist)
- "Hey Nana" (for a grandmother)
- "Hey Duke" (for a jazz musician)

**Tips:**
- Keep it short (2-3 syllables after "Hey")
- Make it distinct from other wake words
- Easy to pronounce clearly
- No tongue-twisters

### Training Process

See the full guide: [TRAIN_WAKE_WORDS.md](TRAIN_WAKE_WORDS.md)

**Summary:**
1. Record 50-100 samples of your wake phrase
2. Record negative samples (similar phrases)
3. Train model using OpenWakeWord tools
4. Test detection accuracy
5. Iterate if needed

**Temporary solution:**
Use an existing pre-trained OpenWakeWord model for initial testing, then train your custom one later.

## Voice Selection

Choose from OpenAI's TTS voices:

| Voice | Description | Good For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **alloy** | Neutral, balanced | General purpose, androids, neutral characters |
| **echo** | Male, clear, professional | Leaders, teachers, formal characters (Mr. Lincoln) |
| **fable** | Male, expressive, storytelling | Narrators, entertainers, dramatic characters |
| **onyx** | Male, deep, casual | Everyday characters, bartenders (Johnny), casual personalities |
| **nova** | Female, warm, friendly | Friendly characters, hosts, welcoming personalities |
| **shimmer** | Female, soft, calm | Gentle characters, soothing personalities |

**Test voices at:** https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech

### Choosing the Right Voice

Consider:
- **Gender** of your character
- **Formality** level (casual vs. professional)
- **Energy** level (calm vs. expressive)
- **Age** perception (younger vs. older sounding)

## Testing Your Personality

### Initial Test

1. **Start the system:**
   ```bash
   python -m teddy_ruxpin.main
   ```

2. **Check startup:**
   - Does it load without errors?
   - Is the personality name displayed?
   - Is the wake word shown?

3. **Test wake word:**
   - Say the wake phrase
   - Does it detect reliably?
   - Does it respond?

4. **Have a conversation:**
   - Ask character-appropriate questions
   - Test their knowledge areas
   - Try edge cases (random questions)
